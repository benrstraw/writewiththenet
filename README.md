# ~write.withthe.net~

## 10/23/2018 Edit:
Well, a year after KnightHacks 2017, UCF's 24-hour hackathon during which this was created, the withthe.net domain has expired. The service itself was already very spotty with it's uptime, migrating across multiple VPSs and expereincing consecutive weeks of downtime. At this time, there are no plans to renew the domain or revive this service. It was a blast to build, but not as much fun to actually use, and thus it's time to officially kill off write.withthe.net. Keep an eye out for what we might create for the next KnightHacks, which was pushed back to Spring 2019!

## Original README
write.withthe.net is a collaborative story-telling experience. It allows users one chance to contribute to an on-going community-driven story, but there's a twist: each user is only allowed to submit one snippet, and only once PER story. This forces the users to decide to either work together to create a coherent story, or let it fall apart. Those who have already submitted their snippet, can watch the story grow, but can't do anything about it until it's "published", at the end of it's life-cycle.
> ## The idea behind the website.
Many online, cooperative games lack a solid storyline, and a game like this allows the users to decide where they want the story to go, and can bounce ideas off one another, and watch as their story grows.

The framework (backend) was developed in Python, and the website itself is written with HTML, javascript, and CSS. These are all great beginner languages, and it's strongly advised that those who are looking to gain experience in any of these languages look over the source code for inspiration and educational purposes.

We had a lot of fun building this, and hope you all enjoy it,
