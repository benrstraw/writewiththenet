      The vision here is to allow users to curate their own stories,
      in an interesting way, by only providing them with one line:
      the response of the last user to have visited the site.
      Users have full control to lead a story, for the one line they
      are given to respond with. Stories will go away eventually, and users
      who have contributed will only be able to see them with user accounts.
